# Ethereum-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Techniques

Need of the Study-

Predicting cryptocurrency price is difficult this is because it is volatile especially since it’s still nascent in its development.
There are various types of cryptocurrencies in the market today and the most common among them which is widely known is Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
 
This project will help us perform prediction of Ethereum by building a model for each technique used in Time Series.

Objective of the Project-

The objective of this project is to calculate future predictions by implementing three different techniques in Time Series.

The techniques used are ARIMA, Holt-Winter’s Technique and finally we will build a model using 
Prophet library which is the most important library used by Facebook for performing future prediction.
